# myportfolio
This is a portfolio website created from scratch based on "TheWebShala" course.

I might update this project based on my needs or archive it as well.

The main reason I'm building a portfolio, is to display my achievements and most important, improve my coding skills.

If you find this repository suitable for your portfolio, you can use it and modify in any way you desire.
