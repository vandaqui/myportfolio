# myportfolio
This is a portfolio website created from scratch based on the "TheWebShala" course.

I might update this project based on my needs or archive it as well.

The main reason I'm coding a portfolio, is to display my achievements and most important, to improve my coding skills.

If you find this repository suitable for your portfolio, you may use it and modify in any way you desire.

The portfolio is based on  HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. You will find it easy to read because all sections and functions are properly commented and indented.
